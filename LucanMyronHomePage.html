            <h3>Job Description</h3>
            <p> 
                A Software Developer is sort of a blanket term. The duties of a developer can range from creating software and applications, 
                designing machine code, developing video games, updating existing software, and so much more. A good software developer
                is knowledgeable in a few different coding languages. While they don't typically need to be an expert it is preferred that 
                developers, new and seasoned, be familiar with concepts like software development life cycles (SDLCs), Object Oriented Programming,
                testing, and more.

            <h3>Required Skills</h3>
            <p>
                Soft skills such as communication, networking, or teamwork will help applicants get their foot in the door. However, there is a wide 
                range of skills that developers need to be more desirable. This includes certifications and knowledge in several different coding languages.
                JavaScript, Java, and Python are some of the most popular languages used in business today. Knowing what industry uses what and then learning
                that language(s) will prepare individuals best.

                When it comes to software development and many other developer jobs there are a myriad of avenues individuals can take. Coding
                boot camps, computer science degrees, and learning at your own pace are viable options. However, it is important to remember that
                that the developer field is heavily saturated and people applying for jobs will likely face a very rigorous interview process
                where their advanced skills and knowledge will be tested and likely ranked amongst 100's of other applicants. While a computer science
                degree isn't necessary, it should be considered. If that is not possible though, focusing on projects and gaining more and more experience
                with other coding languages will almost certainly give applicants a leg up.

                According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-5">
                United States Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> the median annual pay is $132,270 for a software developer. With the lower end being over $77k 
                and the higher range of over $208k. What this largely comes down to is location and type of job. There is also a person's self worth. In other 
                words, don't be afraid to ask for more if you feel your talents have greater value.
